# Two-Dimensional-Classification-Involving-Non-Convex-Decision-Regions
Two-dimensional binary classification problem involving non-convex decision regions i.e., C1 &amp; C2. 
The proposed solution employs a Back Propagation Network to distinguish whether an input pattern belongs to class C1 or C2.
The distribution of pattern classes is as shown below.

Class C1 consists of pattern points marked inside the area marked C1 and class C2 consisits of pattern points inside the area marked C2.

The proposed solution evaluates the network based on a number of metrics i.e., accuracy, loss, confusion matrix. In this regard, I have plotted error curves for training and validation sets and studied the impact of varying model hyperparamters on the performance. 
The results obtained depict high classification accuaracy and minimize overfitting.
