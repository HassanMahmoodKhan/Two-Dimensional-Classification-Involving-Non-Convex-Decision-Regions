# Two-Dimensional-Classification-Involving-Non-Convex-Decision-Regions
Two-dimensional binary classification problem involving non-convex decision regions i.e., C1 &amp; C2. The proposed solution employs a Back Propagation Network to distinguish whether an input pattern belongs to class C1 or C2.
The distribution of pattern classes is as shown below.
